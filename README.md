# King's Hotel

I started the king's hotel when Code Institute assigned me this project, which will have to include 4-5 pages of front-end web development skills that I have learned from the course so far. I designed and created the king's hotel as a getaway for people in touch with their natural side, or for people to test their courage. Unfortunately, the page is completely fictional but I will be updating it when I learn JavaScript, as there are so many features left that I want to implement.

Please take a look at [King's hotel](HTTPS://fordalex.github.io/milestone-project/)

## UX

I tried to make the process as quick and easy for the user to book their stay, with two sections to check the availability and a 'book now' button in the footer of each page. Also, I have made sure that the design is pleasing with loads of pictures of trees, mountains and even parachuting just to give the user an idea of what to expect in booking a stay at the king's hotel. 

As a user myself I like to find out information about what it is I'm booking and then being able to book that thing with as little effort and clicks as possible is important. I have tried to minimalize the leg work for the user by making sure there is easy access to book their stay and check the availability with JavaScript (Yet to implement).

The navigation bar at the top of the page with links to the other pages makes to easy for the user to gain asses to any of the information they need about the hotel. The hotel information page is quite long so to help the user when you click on 'hotel info' a dropdown box appears and gives you a few options on what the user might be looking for and then will take them to that section of the page.

## Pages

* Home page - Landing section: In this section, I just added a big image to show the user what this site is going to be about, there is a button that will take you to the reviews section and if you don't want to leave this page, just one review is showing underneath. At the bottom of this section, there is a part where the user can check the availability.

* Home page - Location and welcome section: basic page with all the information in two small bite-size pieces giving the user the location of the hotel and also a video to watch to get them excited about there stay. There is also a button that the user can press taking them to pictures of the hotel on the 'hotel info' page.

* Hotel info page - Pictures section: The user made it to this page either by going to the navigation bar at the top of the page or pressing the link at the bottom of the 'home' page. Images of the hotel and the landmarks are displayed in this section.

* Hotel info page -  Prices and faculties section: I have designed the rating indicators in the shape of logs to stay in theme with the hotel and to show the user how good the hotel ratings are. More information is shown underneath about what is nearby, what the hotel includes and again the customer can check the availability.

* Hotel info page - Packages section: There are three different packages you can get so far, in each section I have added activities you can do while your at king's hotel, below the activities, are links to the website that managers that scheme.

* Hotel info page - reviews section: The last portion of this page I have added a reviews section where happy guests can leave the information on there stay and a rating from zero to five.

* Book now page: This page is not too long to keep the customer on track on why they selected this page. The two main components of this page are the 'book now' and the 'contact us', the book now section you will be able to select the dates you are available for and find out the price. 

## Features

The home page and the book now page the layouts are the same so I managed to use the same code for the two sections and a vertical line just to save some time re-writing code. When you press on the packages section 'learn more' button the terms and conditions will appear on a modal in the center on the page. 

All of the JavaScript will be done using bootstrap, I will be using bootstrap for the drop-down menu in the navigation bar also for some of the layouts.

## Existing Features

* The first feature being the windows in the home page as you scroll to see further information the user will see little snippets of hot air balloons and the forest, this feature has no function other than to keep the page looking interesting and to try and keep the user on the page.

* I've also added two sections that you can check the availability (Front end only), This allows the user to see what dates are available for booking by filling out the fields required.

* They say a picture can say a thousand words so having compelling background images helps the appearance of the site, on the home page the first thing you see is the title intertwined into the background image, to try and give the idea that the hotel also correlates to the forest and nature.

* The background image on the 'book now' page I have used Blender and Photoshop to create an interesting-looking contact number out the phone wire, to keep things interesting and a bit different to the competition.

## Features left to implement

* The pictures section on mobile only has one image being shown, the reason for this is to keep everything neat and JavaScript will need to be implemented so when the image is pressed that you can scroll through the other images available. Same for the Ipad view only six appear and desktop nine so if more pictures are needed they can just be added on the slide show.

* On the book now page as you filling out the form I want the calculations to be automated and add up as the user fills out the fields.

* FAQ is a button at the bottom of the book now/contact us page, a modal will appear after being selected with the most asked questions on, to save time for the customer and managing the site.

* The 'show more' links on the faculties and landmark sections don't work as I felt I had shown my skills on the rest of the site, this hasn't been done to save time. But if I do complete this site I will just add a modal with more information on.

* BOOK NOW! I have added many ways for the user to check the availability and easy access to 'book now' buttons, a fixed element at the bottom right of the hotel information page reminds the user they can book there stay at anytime and they don't need to try and find there way to the book now page.

* Also while the user scroll's down the hotel information page a 'book now' element is fixed to the bottom right side of the page making sure not to cover up any content, but prompting the user to book as soon as there happy with the information about the hotel. I was inspired to add this feature by [InterContinental](HTTPS://www.ihg.com/intercontinental/hotels/gb/en/reservation).

## Technologies Used

* Adobe XD - This program was used to build the wireframes to this project, and will be using for future projects as I didn't notice many limitations.

* Blender3D - I used this to create the background image for the book now page as I'm quite familiar with this program and you can get some good realistic results. 

* Photoshop - Used for rescaling the images, creating the background image on the home page to give the illusion the title is part of the image. Also used for touching up the book now background image.

* Font Awesome - Used for the icons.

* bootstrap4 - Used to speed up the building process and for some parts of the project using their grid layout.

* Pexels - Used for the free images.

* google Font - Added the different fonts using this program.

* HTML 5 - Used to add the content on the site.

* CSS 3 - Used to style to content and the responsive layout.

## Testing

For each section of this project, I made sure that I resized the viewport to every possible size, I had to remove/change a few features for different views to give the best possible experience for the user.

The home page background image is too big to fit on all the screen sizes so media queries change the image to a small title in the top left corner.

The windows on the home page are only for desktop as I ran into a bug on the mobile view where the fixed background images don't stay fixed and it didn't give the look I wanted.

The rating indicators on the hotel information page on desktop look nice all on one row but then on the mobile view didn't all fit, so I had to write another bit of code to collapse the section into two rows which gives a much more pleasing viewing experience for mobile view.
